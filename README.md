The shell script file contains the commands used to analyze and
evaluate the data. Please read that for more information. 

The Benign/ and Malicious/ directories contain the datasets that I
used, specifically the processed feature vectors. For replicating the
results based on the report files alone, comment out all invocations
of the feature extractor in the shell script, as the original
disassembled files were way too large to include in this repository.
